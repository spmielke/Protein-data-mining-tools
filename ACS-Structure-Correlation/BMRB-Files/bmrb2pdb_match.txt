        BMRB Entries Manually Matched to PDB NMR Entries          [Image]
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following list of BMRB entries with corresponding PDB entries has been
generated by hand and is not a complete list of all BMRB entries that have
matching PDB entries. The list is currently under construction and will be
extended continually as new BMRB and PDB entries are released. Each BMRB and
PDB entry has been reviewed to confirm that the authors and/or the citation
are consistent, to determine the homology of the biopolymer sequence between
the paired entries (SEQRES record for the PDB entry and the monomeric
polymer sequence for the BMRB entry), and to compare other characteristics
of the entries including the presence of ligands etc. Discrepancies between
the entries are noted in the comment section of the table.

Please report any errors or comments to the BMRB help desk.
